# Design Decisions

This document explains the key design decisions behind GocciaScript — the "why" behind the choices.

## Pure Evaluator Functions

The evaluator (`Goccia.Evaluator.pas`) is designed around pure functions — given the same AST node and evaluation context, the evaluator always produces the same result with no side effects.

**Why this matters:**

- **Testability** — Pure functions are trivially testable in isolation.
- **Reasoning** — No hidden state mutations make the evaluation logic easier to understand and debug.
- **Parallelism potential** — Pure evaluation is inherently safe for concurrent execution.
- **Composability** — Evaluator sub-modules (`Arithmetic`, `Bitwise`, `Comparison`, etc.) compose cleanly because they don't share mutable state.
- **ECMAScript conformance** — `ToPrimitive` (`Goccia.Values.ToPrimitive.pas`) is a standalone abstract operation (trying `valueOf` then `toString` on objects) used by the `+` operator and available to any module. The arithmetic module uses floating-point modulo (not integer) with proper NaN/Infinity propagation. The comparison module implements the Abstract Relational Comparison algorithm with type coercion.

State changes (variable bindings, object mutations) happen through the scope and value objects passed in the `TGocciaEvaluationContext`, not through evaluator-internal state.

## Interface-Based Value System

Values use FreePascal interfaces rather than a flat class hierarchy with virtual methods:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    TGocciaValue <|-- TGocciaNullLiteralValue
    TGocciaValue <|-- TGocciaUndefinedLiteralValue
    TGocciaValue <|-- TGocciaBooleanLiteralValue
    TGocciaValue <|-- TGocciaNumberLiteralValue
    TGocciaValue <|-- TGocciaStringLiteralValue
    TGocciaValue <|-- TGocciaObjectValue
    TGocciaValue <|-- TGocciaError

    TGocciaObjectValue <|-- TGocciaArrayValue
    TGocciaObjectValue <|-- TGocciaFunctionValue
    TGocciaObjectValue <|-- TGocciaClassValue
    TGocciaObjectValue <|-- TGocciaInstanceValue
```

Capabilities are expressed through interfaces:

| Interface | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `IPropertyMethods` | Object-like property access (`GetProperty`, `AssignProperty`, `DefineProperty`, etc.) |
| `IIndexMethods` | Array-like indexed access (`GetLength`, `GetElement`, `SetElement`) |

**Why interfaces over inheritance?**

- **Interface segregation** — A value type only implements what it supports. Arrays implement `IIndexMethods`; objects implement `IPropertyMethods`. There's no god-class with unused virtual methods.
- **Capability checking** — The evaluator checks `if Value is IPropertyMethods` rather than maintaining a type enum, making it extensible without modifying existing code.
- **FreePascal compatibility** — Interfaces provide reference counting, which helps with memory management.
- **Lean surface** — Interfaces that were never queried at runtime (`IValueOf`, `IStringTag`, `IFunctionMethods`) have been removed. The methods they declared still exist on the class hierarchy but without the interface indirection overhead.

## Singleton Special Values

Special values like `undefined`, `null`, `true`, `false`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity` are singletons:

```pascal
function UndefinedValue: TGocciaValue;  // Always returns the same instance
function NullValue: TGocciaValue;       // Always returns the same instance
```

**Why singletons?**

- **Identity comparison** — `Value = UndefinedValue` is a fast pointer comparison instead of type checking.
- **Memory efficiency** — These values are created once and shared.
- **Semantic correctness** — There's only one `undefined` in JavaScript; the implementation reflects this.

## Number Representation

Numbers use a dual representation — a `Double` for normal values and a `TGocciaNumberSpecialValue` enum for `NaN`, `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `-0`:

**Why not just `Double`?**

- **NaN identity** — IEEE 754 `NaN ≠ NaN`, but JavaScript needs `NaN` to be identifiable. A dedicated enum avoids floating-point comparison pitfalls.
- **Negative zero** — `-0` and `+0` are equal in IEEE 754 but distinguishable in JavaScript (`Object.is(-0, +0)` is `false`). Explicit tracking prevents this from being lost.
- **Display correctness** — `NaN.toString()` must return `"NaN"`, not some floating-point artifact.

## Scope Chain Design

Scopes form a tree with parent pointers, implementing lexical scoping:

- **`CreateChild` factory method** — Scopes are never instantiated directly. `CreateChild` ensures proper parent linkage and scope kind propagation.
- **Temporal Dead Zone** — `let`/`const` bindings are registered before initialization, enforcing TDZ semantics (accessing before `=` throws `ReferenceError`).
- **Specialized scopes** — `TGocciaCatchScope`, `TGocciaGlobalScope`, and `TGocciaClassScope` handle their unique semantics (catch parameter shadowing, global object, superclass tracking).

## Property Descriptor System

Object properties follow ECMAScript's property descriptor model:

- **Data descriptors** — `{ value, writable, enumerable, configurable }`
- **Accessor descriptors** — `{ get, set, enumerable, configurable }`
- **Insertion order** — Properties maintain their creation order, matching JavaScript's `Object.keys()` ordering guarantee.

This is more complex than a simple key-value map, but it's necessary for `Object.defineProperty`, getters/setters, and non-enumerable properties like prototype methods.

Class getters and setters are stored as accessor descriptors on the class prototype. `TGocciaObjectValue.GetProperty` and `AssignProperty` are `virtual`, and `TGocciaInstanceValue` overrides both to intercept property access — checking the prototype for accessor descriptors and invoking getter/setter functions with the instance as `this` context.

## Private Field Storage

Private fields use **composite keys** (`ClassName:FieldName`) in the instance's private property dictionary. This solves the inheritance shadowing problem where a base class and a derived class both declare a private field with the same name — in JavaScript, `Base.#x` and `Derived.#x` are completely separate slots.

- **Storage** — Private fields are stored on `TGocciaInstanceValue.FPrivateProperties` using keys like `"Base:x"` and `"Derived:x"`.
- **Access resolution** — When a method accesses `this.#x`, the evaluator resolves which class declared the method (via `__owning_class__` in the scope chain) and uses that class name to build the composite key.
- **Private getters/setters** — Stored separately from public ones on `TGocciaClassValue` in `FPrivateGetters`/`FPrivateSetters`, because they don't participate in the prototype's property descriptor chain.
- **Declaration order** — Instance property initializers run in source declaration order, enforced via `TStringList` order tracking from the parser through to the class value.

## Error Handling Strategy

GocciaScript uses a layered error approach:

1. **Compile-time errors** (lexer/parser) use Pascal exceptions (`TGocciaLexerError`, `TGocciaSyntaxError`) — these terminate parsing immediately.
2. **Runtime errors** use a callback pattern (`OnError` in `TGocciaEvaluationContext`) — this keeps evaluator functions pure.
3. **JavaScript-level errors** use `TGocciaThrowValue` for `throw` statements and `try/catch` — these flow through the evaluator's return path.
4. **`try-finally` without `catch`** — The evaluator wraps the Pascal `try...except` in a Pascal `try...finally` to guarantee the JS `finally` block runs before exceptions propagate, even when no `catch` clause exists.
5. **`break` in `switch`** — Uses `TGocciaBreakSignal` (a Pascal exception) to exit `switch` cases. The `EvaluateSwitch` function catches this signal to implement JavaScript's fall-through-until-break semantics.

**Centralized error construction** — `Goccia.Values.ErrorHelper.pas` provides `ThrowTypeError`, `ThrowRangeError`, `ThrowReferenceError`, and `CreateErrorObject` helpers. All error throw sites across the codebase use these helpers instead of manually building error objects, reducing duplication and ensuring consistent error formatting.

**Why not exceptions everywhere?** Pascal exceptions disrupt the pure-function model of the evaluator. The callback pattern allows the evaluator to signal errors without unwinding the call stack, making control flow explicit. The exceptions to this rule (`TGocciaThrowValue`, `TGocciaReturnValue`, `TGocciaBreakSignal`) are used only for non-local exits where unwinding is the intended behavior.

## Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector

GocciaScript runs inside a FreePascal host with manual memory management. Despite this, the runtime uses a tracing garbage collector (`Goccia.GarbageCollector.pas`) rather than relying on manual `Free` calls or reference counting.

**Why not manual memory management?**

- **Aliased references** — A value assigned to multiple variables, captured in a closure, and stored in an array has no single owner. Determining when to free it requires tracking all references.
- **Shared prototypes** — Array methods, function prototypes, and class prototypes are shared across many instances. Manual lifetime tracking would be fragile.
- **Closure captures** — Arrow functions capture their enclosing scope, creating non-obvious reference chains between scopes and values.

**Why not reference counting (via `TInterfacedObject`)?**

`TGocciaValue` inherits from `TInterfacedObject`, which provides automatic reference counting. However, values are stored as class references (`TGocciaValue`), not interface references. Switching to interface variables throughout the evaluator would require a large-scale refactor and introduce circular reference issues (objects referencing their prototypes and vice versa).

**Why mark-and-sweep?**

- **Simplicity** — Two phases (mark reachable, sweep unreachable) with straightforward implementation.
- **Handles cycles** — Circular references between objects, closures, and scopes are collected correctly.
- **Measurable impact** — Running `GC.Collect` before benchmark measurement rounds reduced ops/sec variance from 20-30% to 1-3%.

**AST literal values and `GCPermanent`:**

The parser creates `TGocciaValue` instances (numbers, strings, booleans) and stores them inside `TGocciaLiteralExpression` AST nodes. These values auto-register with the GC but are invisible to the mark phase, which only traverses scopes and roots — not the AST. Without protection, the GC would free them and subsequent evaluations of the same AST node would access freed memory.

The solution is the `GCPermanent` flag: `TGocciaLiteralExpression.Create` sets `GCPermanent := True` on its value. The sweep phase skips permanent values unconditionally. This is correct because AST nodes live for the entire script execution, so their values should never be collected. An alternative would be having the AST own its values (freeing them in destructors), but that would require the evaluator to create runtime copies of every literal — adding allocation overhead to the hot path.

## Configurable Built-ins

Built-ins are registered via a `TGocciaGlobalBuiltins` set of flags:

```pascal
TGocciaGlobalBuiltin = (ggConsole, ggMath, ggGlobalObject, ggGlobalArray,
                         ggGlobalNumber, ggPromise, ggJSON, ggSymbol,
                         ggSet, ggMap, ggTestAssertions);
```

**Why configurable?**

- **Security** — Embedding environments can restrict available APIs. A sandboxed script might not get `console`.
- **Testing** — The TestRunner enables `ggTestAssertions` to inject `describe`, `test`, and `expect` without polluting the normal runtime.
- **Minimal footprint** — Only register what's needed.

## Build System

The build script (`build.pas`) is itself a FreePascal script executed via `instantfpc`:

**Why a Pascal build script?**

- **Dogfooding** — The project uses its own language ecosystem for tooling.
- **No external dependencies** — No Make, CMake, npm, or other build tools required beyond FreePascal itself.
- **Cross-platform** — The same build script works on all platforms.

## Testing Strategy

JavaScript end-to-end tests are the **primary** testing mechanism. Every new feature or bug fix must include JavaScript tests that validate the behavior through the full pipeline (lexer → parser → evaluator).

- **Specification by example** — Each test file is a runnable specification of expected behavior.
- **End-to-end validation** — Tests exercise the full pipeline, catching integration issues that unit tests would miss.
- **Readable specifications** — JavaScript test files are readable by anyone familiar with Jest/Vitest conventions.
- **Source of truth** — If a behavior isn't covered by a JavaScript test, it isn't guaranteed.

Pascal unit tests (`*.Test.pas`) exist as a secondary layer for internal implementation details not reachable from script code.
