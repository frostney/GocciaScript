# Garbage Collector

*Unified mark-and-sweep garbage collector shared by both the interpreter and bytecode VM.*

## Executive Summary

- **Mark-and-sweep** — Two-phase tracing GC (`Goccia.GarbageCollector.pas`) shared by both execution backends
- **Auto-registration** — Every `TGocciaValue` registers with the GC via `AfterConstruction`; subclasses override `MarkReferences` to mark owned references
- **Weak reference phase** — WeakMap and WeakSet use post-mark weak tracing/sweeping hooks so weak keys and values do not become strong roots
- **Generation-counter marking** — O(1) mark-clear via `AdvanceMark` instead of O(n) flag reset per collection
- **Pinned singletons** — `undefined`, `null`, `true`, `false`, `NaN`, `Infinity` are pinned once at engine startup; built-in prototypes are pinned per-engine via [realm slots](core-patterns.md#realm-ownership--slot-registration) and released atomically when the realm is destroyed
- **Adaptive threshold** — Collection frequency scales with surviving object count to amortize cost on large heaps

## Value Integration

Every `TGocciaValue` participates in the garbage collector:

```pascal
TGCManagedObject = class
private class var
  FCurrentMark: Cardinal;      // Generation counter — incremented each collection
private
  FGCMark: Cardinal;           // Per-object mark — matches FCurrentMark when alive
  FGCIndex: Integer;           // Index in FManagedObjects for O(1) unregistration
public
  class procedure AdvanceMark; static; inline;
  procedure MarkReferences; virtual;
  function TraceWeakReferences: Boolean; virtual;
  procedure SweepWeakReferences; virtual;
  property GCMarked: Boolean read GetGCMarked write SetGCMarked;
  property GCIndex: Integer read FGCIndex write FGCIndex;
end;

TGocciaValue = class(TGCManagedObject)
  procedure AfterConstruction; override;  // Auto-registers with GC
  function RuntimeCopy: TGocciaValue; virtual;  // Create a GC-managed copy
end;
```

- **`AfterConstruction`** — Every value auto-registers with `TGarbageCollector.Instance` upon creation.
- **`MarkReferences`** — Base implementation sets `FGCMark := FCurrentMark` (marking the object as alive for the current collection). Subclasses override this to also mark values they reference (e.g., `TGocciaObjectValue` marks its prototype and property values, `TGocciaFunctionValue` marks its closure scope, `TGocciaArrayValue` marks its elements). The `if GCMarked then Exit;` guard at the top of each override prevents re-visiting objects in cyclic reference graphs.
- **`TraceWeakReferences` / `SweepWeakReferences`** — Optional hooks for weak containers. The default implementations do nothing. WeakMap uses `TraceWeakReferences` as an ephemeron pass: if a key is already marked by normal roots, its value is marked, but the key is never marked by the map. WeakMap and WeakSet use `SweepWeakReferences` to remove entries whose keys/values remain unmarked.
- **`RuntimeCopy`** — Creates a fresh GC-managed copy of the value. Used by the evaluator when evaluating literal expressions: AST-owned literal values are not tracked by the GC, so `RuntimeCopy` produces a runtime value that is. The default implementation returns `Self` (for singletons and complex values). Primitives override this: numbers use the `SmallInt` cache for 0-255, booleans return singletons, strings create new instances (cheap due to copy-on-write).

## Contributor Rules

When working with the GC, follow these rules:

- **Override `MarkReferences`** in every value type that holds `TGocciaValue` references. Call `inherited` first, then mark each owned reference.
- **Pin singletons** — `UndefinedValue`, `TrueValue`, `NaNValue`, etc. are pinned via `PinObject` during engine initialization (consolidated in `PinPrimitiveSingletons`). Built-in prototype singletons are stored per-engine in realm slots (see next bullet); the realm pins them on `SetSlot` and releases them on `Destroy`, so contributors do not need to call `PinObject` from `InitializePrototype` themselves.
- **Realm-owned pinning** — Built-in prototypes are stored in per-engine [realm slots](core-patterns.md#realm-ownership--slot-registration). `TGocciaRealm.SetSlot` pins the stored object via `PinObject`; the realm tracks every pin it took and releases all of them in `Destroy` via `UnpinObject`. Owned-slot helpers (`TGocciaSharedPrototype` instances) are `Free`d before the pin-release pass, so their destructors can still call `UnpinObject` on objects they own. This means engine tear-down releases the entire intrinsic prototype graph atomically — embedders should not pin or unpin built-in prototypes manually.
- **Protect stack-held values** — Values held only by Pascal code (not in any GocciaScript scope) must be protected with `AddTempRoot`/`RemoveTempRoot`.
- **Use `CollectIfNeeded(AProtect)`** when holding a `TGCManagedObject` on the stack. The no-arg `CollectIfNeeded` is only safe when all live values are already rooted.
- **Weak containers must not mark keys during `MarkReferences`**. Put weak-value propagation in `TraceWeakReferences` and dead-entry pruning in `SweepWeakReferences`; otherwise WeakMap/WeakSet semantics collapse into strong Map/Set semantics.
- **Scopes** register/unregister with the GC in their constructor/destructor. Active call scopes are tracked via `PushActiveRoot`/`PopActiveRoot`.
- **VM register rooting** only traverses object-bearing register slots.
- Automatic collection is disabled during bytecode execution. CLI hosts may still call `Collect` explicitly between files; the benchmark runner does this after each benchmark file, while parallel test workers reclaim their thread-local GC heap at worker shutdown.

## Design Rationale

### Why Not Manual Memory Management?

- **Aliased references** — A value assigned to multiple variables, captured in a closure, and stored in an array has no single owner. Determining when to free it requires tracking all references.
- **Shared prototype singletons** — String, Number, Array, Set, Map, Function, Symbol, and other built-in prototype objects are per-engine singletons stored in [realm slots](core-patterns.md#realm-ownership--slot-registration) and shared across all instances of their type within the same engine. Each type's `InitializePrototype` creates the singleton once (guarded by checking the realm slot) and stores it via `TGocciaRealm.SetSlot` / `SetOwnedSlot`, which pins it with the GC. Manual lifetime tracking would be fragile; the realm releases all of its pins atomically in `Destroy`.
- **Closure captures** — Arrow functions capture their enclosing scope, creating non-obvious reference chains between scopes and values.

### Why Not Reference Counting?

`TGocciaValue` inherits from `TGCManagedObject`, which is a plain `TObject` descendant — there is no reference counting. Values are stored as class references (`TGocciaValue`), and lifetime is managed entirely by the mark-and-sweep GC. Using interface-based reference counting would require a large-scale refactor and introduce circular reference issues (objects referencing their prototypes and vice versa).

### Why Mark-and-Sweep?

- **Simplicity** — Two phases (mark reachable, sweep unreachable) with straightforward implementation.
- **Handles cycles** — Circular references between objects, closures, and scopes are collected correctly.
- **O(1) membership checks** — Pinned objects, temp roots, and root objects are stored in `THashMap<TGCManagedObject, Boolean>` (`TGCObjectSet`) for O(1) `PinObject`, `AddRootObject`, `AddTempRoot`, and `RemoveTempRoot` operations, avoiding O(n) linear scans on every allocation.
- **Generation-counter mark tracking** — Instead of clearing the `GCMarked` flag on every object at the start of each collection (an O(n) pass), the GC uses a generation counter (`TGCManagedObject.FCurrentMark`). `AdvanceMark` increments the counter in O(1), and an object is considered "marked" when its `FGCMark` matches `FCurrentMark`. This eliminates a full pass over the managed objects list per collection.
- **O(1) `UnregisterObject`** — Each managed object stores its index in the managed objects list (`GCIndex`). Unregistration nils the slot at the known index instead of performing an O(n) linear scan. The sweep phase compacts nil slots during its existing pass.
- **Adaptive threshold** — After each collection, the threshold scales to `max(DEFAULT_GC_THRESHOLD, surviving_count)`, so large heaps collect proportionally less often, amortizing collection cost to O(1) per allocation.
- **Weak fixed-point tracing** — After normal root marking, the collector repeatedly visits marked objects' weak hooks until no hook marks anything new. This handles ephemeron chains such as a live WeakMap key exposing a value that then keeps another WeakMap key alive. After the fixed point, marked weak containers sweep entries whose weak keys or values are still unmarked, then the normal object sweep frees unreachable objects.
- **`Recycle` virtual method** — Sweep calls `Obj.Recycle` instead of `Obj.Free`. The default calls `Free`, but subclasses can override to return objects to a pool.
- **Measurable impact** — Both the GocciaBenchmarkRunner and GocciaTestRunner call `Collect` after each file to reclaim memory between script executions.

## Memory Ceiling

The GC tracks approximate heap usage via `InstanceSize` per registered object. A byte ceiling is always active:

- **Default:** half of physical memory, capped at 8 GB on 64-bit or 700 MB on 32-bit. Falls back to 512 MB when OS detection fails.
- **Override:** `--max-memory=<bytes>` sets an explicit limit.

Any allocation that pushes `BytesAllocated` above `MaxBytes` raises a JavaScript `RangeError`. The error is catchable with `try/catch`; after catching, the script can call `Goccia.gc()` to free unreachable objects and retry.

From JavaScript, `Goccia.gc.bytesAllocated` and `Goccia.gc.maxBytes` are read-only getters. The ceiling can only be changed from the engine level (CLI flag or Pascal API: `TGarbageCollector.Instance.MaxBytes`).

### Physical memory detection

| Platform | API | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| macOS/Darwin | `sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES) * sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)` | Declared as `external 'c'` inline |
| Linux | `sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES) * sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)` | Same API, different constant values |
| Windows | `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` (kernel32.dll) | Declared inline because the standard FPC 3.2.2 `Windows` unit only provides the older `GlobalMemoryStatus`, which [Microsoft documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-globalmemorystatus) as capping `dwTotalPhys` at 2 GB on x86 systems with 2-4 GB of RAM. `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` uses 64-bit `DWORDLONG` fields (`ullTotalPhys`) that report correctly on all systems. |

### Scaling constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES` | 512 MB | Fallback when OS memory detection fails |
| `MAX_BYTES_CAP_64BIT` | 8 GB | Upper bound on 64-bit targets |
| `MAX_BYTES_CAP_32BIT` | 700 MB | Upper bound on 32-bit targets |

The formula is `min(physicalMemory / 2, platformCap)`.

### What `BytesAllocated` tracks

`BytesAllocated` sums `InstanceSize` of each `TGCManagedObject` registered with the GC. This covers the Delphi/FPC object instance (vtable, fields, padding) but **not** backing storage allocated separately by the object (e.g., dynamic array buffers in `TGocciaArrayValue`, string heap allocations in `TGocciaStringLiteralValue`). The ceiling is therefore an approximate safety net, not a precise memory accounting system.

### Threading model

Each worker thread creates its own `TGarbageCollector` instance via `threadvar`. The `--max-memory` ceiling is propagated from the main thread's GC to each worker via `TGocciaThreadPool.MaxBytes` → `InitThreadRuntime(AMaxBytes)`.

Key behavior on worker threads:

- **Automatic GC collection is disabled** (`Enabled := False`) to avoid `FGCMark` races on shared immutable objects (primitive singletons, shared prototypes). Explicit host-side `Collect` calls can still run; `GocciaBenchmarkRunner` uses this after each benchmark file, while `GocciaTestRunner` avoids worker-side collection and lets worker shutdown reclaim the thread-local GC heap.
- **`BytesAllocated` still increments** on every allocation, even with automatic collection disabled. Without explicit host collection, the counter grows across all files a worker processes.
- **The memory ceiling check still fires.** The limit check in `TGocciaValue.AfterConstruction` does not depend on `GC.Enabled` — it checks `MaxBytes > 0` and `BytesAllocated > MaxBytes` regardless. This is the sole protection against unbounded memory growth on workers.
- **No pre-allocation.** `MaxBytes` is a threshold, not a reservation. Memory is allocated on demand by the FPC heap manager; the GC only checks whether the running total exceeds the ceiling.
- **Each worker gets the same ceiling as the main thread.** The limit is per-thread, not divided across workers. With N workers, the theoretical maximum total allocation is `N × MaxBytes`, though in practice worker allocations are far below the ceiling.

CLI JSON reports aggregate worker GC memory once per worker thread. Live and peak values are summed across worker thread-local GC instances, while the limit is the per-worker ceiling. The report deliberately avoids summing per-file live snapshots, because a worker may process many files using the same GC instance.

The separate `memory.heap` JSON object comes from FreePascal's `GetHeapStatus`, not from the GocciaScript GC. It describes allocator state for the process/thread scope being measured. Free-space deltas can be negative when the allocator has less reusable free space at the end of a run; this is not itself evidence of a GocciaScript GC leak.

## JavaScript API

`Goccia.gc()` triggers a full mark-and-sweep collection, bypassing the automatic collection threshold. On worker threads the call is a no-op because shared immutable objects (singletons, prototypes) have a single `FGCMark` field that is not thread-safe for concurrent marking. It is safe to call repeatedly and returns `undefined`.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Goccia.gc()` | `function` | Force a full garbage collection |
| `Goccia.gc.bytesAllocated` | `number` | Approximate bytes currently tracked by the GC (read-only) |
| `Goccia.gc.maxBytes` | `number` | Active byte ceiling (read-only; set via `--max-memory` or auto-detected from OS memory) |

## AST Literal Ownership

The parser creates `TGocciaValue` instances (numbers, strings, booleans) and stores them inside `TGocciaLiteralExpression` AST nodes. These values are owned by the AST, not the GC. `TGocciaLiteralExpression.Create` calls `TGarbageCollector.Instance.UnregisterObject` to remove the value from GC tracking, and `TGocciaLiteralExpression.Destroy` frees the value (unless it is a singleton like `UndefinedValue`, `TrueValue`, or `FalseValue`).

When the evaluator encounters a literal expression, it calls `Value.RuntimeCopy` to produce a fresh GC-managed runtime value. This cleanly separates compile-time constants (owned by the AST) from runtime values (managed by the GC). The overhead is minimal: integers 0-255 hit the `SmallInt` cache (zero allocation), booleans return singletons, and strings benefit from FreePascal's copy-on-write semantics.
